If you encounter a problem when you try to import a file, this file might help you:

---------------------------------

Prob : ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Config' (FOR A PYTHON SCRIPT OR A .TXT FILE)

In this case, your script can't find the file you want to import. In general, all the file are in the same deposits so there is no problem with the path.
But if one of your file is in an other deposit you have to say it if you want to import it.
For example, the path to "Valve.py" is ..../Python Program/Valve Control
        and the path to "Config.py" is ..../Python Program/Parameters of each device
So, they are not in the same folder. If I want to import "Config.py" in Valve what I have to do is :
	
	- import site
	- site.addsitedir("/home/aymerick/Desktop/Stage_Aymerick/python/Python Program")   
	# Instead of looking for Config.py only in the folder "Valve Control", your script will look for this file in "Python Program" too
	- import Config				  
	
If it still not working, try to put everything in the same folder

----------------------------------

Prob : ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pipython' (FOR A LIBRARY)

In this case, your script can't find a library (like serial for example). There is some solutions that can help you:
	- Try to install it with "pip" 

	- Move your library to the folder where all the libraries are. Here, there is a method to find where is a module:
		- Open a terminal
		- Write "$ Python"
		- Write "import <name of your module>" (For example if you installed pyserial and you want to find where he is in your disk)
		- Write "<name of your module>" The answer will be the path to this module
		- Check if your module is in the same deposits than the others. If he is not try to understand why and see if you can move it
		- Restart Spyder
