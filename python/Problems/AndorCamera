If you encounter a problem with the AndorCamera, this file might help you:

---------------------------------

Prob : Unicode Error (Specific to windows ?)

When you give a path for your spool for example, you will have to write it like this :

	C:\\Users\\......\\....\\
	
If you write the path as usual: C:\Users\....\.....\ python will expect numbers after \U

---------------------------------

Prob : 1 argument expected (4 given)

In this case, the problem is the number of arguments your function can handle is wrong.

For example, the function SetShutters needs 4 arguments:

	SetShutters(int ttlType,int mode,int closingTime,int openingTime) (All of the arguments are int)
	
But if you write "self.set_shutter = wrapper(dll.SetShutter, [c_int])", your variable will expect only one argument.

So, this is wrong. The correct command is :

	self.set_shutter = wrapper(dll.SetShutter, [c_int,c_int,c_int,c_int])
