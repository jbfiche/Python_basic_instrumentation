		- VariableName.MoveREL(X,Y) (X and Y are in micrometers)
	2. If you want to move in absolute coordinates:
		- VariableName.MoveABSOL(X,Y) (X and Y are in micrometers)
	3. If you want to save your current position as an ROI:
		- VariableName.MemorizeROI()
	4. If you want to move to all the ROI saved in the file:
		- VariableName.GOTOROI()
	5. If you want to delete all the ROI saved :
		- VariableName.DELETEALLROI()
	6. If you want to change the speed:
		- VariableName.Speed(X,Y)
	7. If you want to change the brightness:
