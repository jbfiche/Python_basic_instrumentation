If you encounter a problem with the USB/RS232 communication with your device, this file might help you:

---------------------------------

Prob : I can't identify the name of the port where my device is pluged
 
In Windows : - Go to your peripherals 
	     - Check witch one is already used (for example 'COM1' and 'COM4')
	     - Unplug your device (for example 'COM4' disapear -> Your device is plug at the port 4)
	     
In Linux:    (USB Case) :
	     - Open a terminal command
	     - Write "ls /dev/tty*"
	     - Unplug your device
	     - Write "ls /dev/tty*" again
	     - See the name of the port wich disapeared
	     
	     (RSB 232 Case) In this case start with this device unpluged 
	     - Open a terminal command
	     - Write " dmesg | grep ttyS"
	     (You will get a list of ports)
	     - Write "sudo cat /proc/tty/driver/serial> /tmp/1"
	     - Plug your device
	     - Write "sudo cat /proc/tty/driver/serial> /tmp/2"
	     - Write "diff /tmp/1 /tmp/2"
	     - By comparating the result with the dmesg output we can determine wich one is the port

Prob : Error 13 : Permission Denied 

I had this problem only with linux so this solution is specific to linux. The problem here is you are not in the dialout group.
To add yourself to this goup you have to :
	- Open a terminal command
	- Write "sudo usermod -a -G dialout <username>"
	where <username> is your Linux user name
	- You will need to log out and log in again for this change to take effect !!!

If this change work you should see your user name in dialout when u write "groups" in a terminal command (Result expected : <username> adm tty dialout sudo
