If you encounter a problem with the 3d-mill coordinates, this file might help you:

---------------------------------

Prob : The coordinates of the origins(0,0,0) has changed or I'm not above the Wells 1

Sometimes, for example if the electricty shutdowns when the 3d-mill is working, the coordinates of the origins will change.
I don't know why. But don't panic this is not a huge problem to solve because all the programs are made to work in relative 
coordinates. So the goal here is basically to go to the point where your Wells 1 is and to start you manipulation.

How to do ?

	- Open the file "Driver.py" with spyder 
	- Go at the end of the program
	- Under "if __name__ =="__main__":", write your instructions.
	- For example, if you want to move in relative coordinates X=+5mm Y=-3mm Z=+2mm, your instructions should look like this:
		- if __name__ == "__main__":
    			cnc = CNC(Config.PortPrinter)
    			cnc.OpenConnection()
    			cnc.Move(91,5,-3,2)
    			cnc.CloseConnection()
	- Then execute your script (press F5)
	
The X,Y,Z axis are written on the 3d-mill.
Use low amplitude movements if you want to be sure you don't damage the device.
Be sure the needle is above the wells before moving in X,Y.
If you want to move only on Z you can write "cnc.Move(91,0,0,2)"for example.
